# C++Quant-Pet 🚀  
**A Complete Beginner → Advanced C++ & Quant Engineering Learning Project**

## Overview
C++Quant-Pet is a long-term, structured learning and portfolio project designed to take a developer from **C++ fundamentals** all the way to **advanced systems, performance engineering, and quantitative finance concepts**.

This repository documents:
- My end-to-end C++ learning journey
- Core computer science and systems knowledge tested in interviews
- Quantitative development foundations used in trading, low-latency systems, and financial engineering
- Practical examples, exercises, and mini-projects

The goal is simple: **build real mastery and become interview-proof for quant, fintech, and FAANG-level roles.**

## Why This Project Exists
Most tutorials teach syntax.  
This project teaches **how C++ actually works under the hood**.

Focus areas include:
- Memory (stack vs heap, allocation, ownership)
- Performance & low-level behavior
- Modern C++ best practices
- Interview-level reasoning
- Real-world engineering tradeoffs

This is not a “hello world” repo — it is a **systems-first learning archive**.

## Learning Roadmap

### 1️⃣ C++ Fundamentals
- Compilation model (preprocessing, compiling, linking)
- `main()`, headers, namespaces
- Variables, types, references, pointers
- Control flow (`if`, `switch`, loops)

### 2️⃣ Memory & Object Lifetime
- Stack vs Heap (critical interview topic)
- `new` / `delete`
- RAII
- Constructors & destructors
- Copy vs move semantics
- Shallow vs deep copy

### 3️⃣ Object-Oriented C++
- Classes & access specifiers
- Constructors, destructors
- Initializer lists
- Encapsulation & abstraction
- Inheritance & polymorphism
- Virtual functions & vtables

### 4️⃣ Standard Template Library (STL)
- Containers (`vector`, `map`, `unordered_map`, `set`)
- Iterators
- Algorithms (`sort`, `find`, `transform`)
- Time complexity analysis

### 5️⃣ Modern C++ (C++11 → C++20)
- `auto`, `constexpr`, `nullptr`
- Smart pointers (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`)
- Lambdas
- Move semantics
- `std::optional`, `std::variant`
- Ranges (C++20)

### 6️⃣ Systems & Performance
- Memory layout & cache locality
- CPU vs RAM costs
- False sharing
- Branch prediction
- Alignment & padding
- Profiling & optimization

### 7️⃣ Multithreading & Concurrency
- Threads vs processes
- `std::thread`
- Mutexes & locks
- Atomic operations
- Lock-free concepts
- Race conditions & deadlocks

### 8️⃣ Quant & Financial Engineering Foundations
- Numerical precision
- Floating-point pitfalls
- Monte Carlo basics
- Order book modeling
- Latency-sensitive design
- Deterministic systems
